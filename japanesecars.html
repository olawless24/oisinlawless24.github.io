    <h2>Japenese Car Market</h2>

    <p class="maintextbox">The JDM (Japanese Domestic Market) car scene has become a global sensation, known for its performance, engineering prowess, and distinct design. Initially produced for the Japanese market, cars like the Nissan Skyline GT-R, Toyota Supra, Mazda RX-7, and Subaru Impreza WRX STI have grown iconic worldwide. These cars became popular not just for their reliability and cutting-edge technology, but also for their tuning potential.
<br><br>
      In the 1990s, Japanese automakers pushed the limits of performance, with the Skyline GT-R dominating motorsports and the Supra MK4 becoming famous for its 2JZ-GTE engine. These models were engineered for turbocharged power, advanced suspension systems, and precision handling, often rivaling European and American sports cars.
<br><br>
      The rise of drifting further boosted the JDM scene, with cars like the Mazda RX-7 and Subaru WRX STI being favorites due to their lightweight builds and responsive handling. The affordability of many JDM models, paired with their modding potential, created a thriving tuning culture that embraced car customization.
<br><br>
      Today, JDM cars are revered worldwide for their affordable performance and unique style, with Supra MK4 and Skyline R34 models fetching high prices in the collector's market. The JDM subculture continues to influence automotive culture, from motorsports to car shows, cementing the legacy of Japanese engineering and performance.</p>
