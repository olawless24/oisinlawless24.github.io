      This website was created by Oisin Lawless and Joe Greene. We made this website to show our love for cars and more specifically the two giants when it comes to car manufacturers. We took our love of cars and researched countlessly for hours, coming up with the information that we decided would suit the topic we had in mind. We offer a lot of information on Japanese and German cars along with a video that we thought would suit our topic. We hope you enjoy our website and you find it useful.
